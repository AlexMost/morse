## Morse test
This project aims to highlight the power of FRP approach for working with async logic (Rx.js lib). It parses input signals, and depending on their duration decodes dot's and dashes in letters and after that combines them in words.

2. Space between letters are equal nearly 3 dot's.
3. Space between words equals nearly 7 dot's.
